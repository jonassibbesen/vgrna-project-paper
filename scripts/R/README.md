# Pantranscriptome analysis R scripts

The R scripts depend on the following packages: `tidyverse`, `gridExtra`,
`scales`, `ggrepel`, `wesanderson`, `truncnorm` and `hlaseqlib`.

The scripts have been tested using R version 3.5.1 on Mac (macOS 10.14.6).

Please note that some of the scripts assume that the data is structured in a specific set of folders. They might therefore require a bit of reworking before they can be used in other environments.
